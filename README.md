# IP-Address-Defanger
 This project aims to create a Python script that defangs IP addresses by replacing dots with another character, preventing unintended hyperlinking in certain contexts. This project provides a simple illustration of the defanging process, allowing users to input an IP address, and then displaying both the original and defanged versions.
